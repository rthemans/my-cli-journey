### Why work with CLI?
For most of my working years, I’ve rarely work within the cli.
I wasn’t really interested in all those technicalities and the IDE was already doing all the work for me.
**So Why bother?**

#### Reasons you might want to try it
- decouple yourself from your IDE
- extend your knowledge on how things work
  - make things your own
  - understand why some stuff is "complicated"
  - ease your workflow
  - adapt easily to new work environments
- it is fun
- there is always something to uncover

#### My personal reasons
Here is the list of elements that made me do the move, ranking from most impactful to the lesser ones.
- Working with projects hosted in WSL but edited from intellij IDEA on windows
- Using NixOS as personal operating system
- Wanting to understand how this all works
- Making my own devops and server management
- Making my home server with home-assistant, jellyfin, portainer,…

### Aim
